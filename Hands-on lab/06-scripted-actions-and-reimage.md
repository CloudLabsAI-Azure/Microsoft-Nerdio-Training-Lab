# Lab 7: Scripted actions and App masking

## Overview

Scripted Actions are a library of PowerShell scripts that can be run in either Azure or AVD Virtual Machines as another step for various tasks performed by Nerdio Manager for MSP. Desktop Auto-scaling feature helps users optimize their costs by paying only for the Nerdio resources used. Desktop auto-scaling takes advantage of the elasticity of cloud-hosted environments to increase or decrease resources as per individual requirements.
