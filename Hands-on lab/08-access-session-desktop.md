# Lab 8: Access Session desktop using Browser

## Overview

Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) integrates virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and the cloud. AVD is Microsoft Azureâ€™s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It enables small to large cloud consumers to provide remote applications and full desktops from Microsoft Cloud to their end-users. Azure Files is also a  platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for AVD users. In this lab, you'll be accessing the Desktop using a browser and verifying the User profiles stored in the File Share

## Exercise 1: Access the Desktop using AVD Desktop Client

In this lab, We will use a Remote Desktop client to verify Microsoft Office 365 access and we will access file share to check the implementation of FSLogix.

1. Open the following URL in a new browser tab in the JumpVM. This URL will lead us to the Remote Desktop Web Client.

   ``` 
   aka.ms/wvdarmweb 
   ``` 
   
1. Enter your **credentials** to access the workspace.

   - Username: *Paste your NMMUser 01 username* **<inject key="Nmm User 01" />** *and then click on **Next**.*

   - Password: Paste the password of ***nmmuser01*** which you had copied earlier in **`Lab 3 -> Exercise 1 -> Step 3`** and click on **Sign in**.*

1. In the Access local resource pop-up window, Click on **Allow**.

   ![](media/ba2.png)
   
1. In Enter your Credentials pop-up window, Provide the Username and Password of NMM User 01 and click on **Submit**.

   ![](media/ba3.png)
   
1. Once logged into the session host, Search for **Word** application using the search bar. We won't be able to find the application as NMM User 01 is not part of the AVD MS Office users group.

1. Sign out from the session host by clicking on the **sign out** from the top-right corner.

1. Enter your **credentials** to access the workspace.

   - Username: *Paste your NMMUser 02 username* **<inject key="Nmm User 02" />** *and then click on **Next**.*
   
   ![ws name.](media/ba5.png)

   - Password: Paste the password of ***nmmuser02*** which you had copied earlier in **`Lab 3 -> Exercise 1 -> Step 6`** and click on **Sign in**.*

   ![ws name.](media/ba6.png)
   
1. In the All Resources tab, Click on the **AVD-HP-01** icon to access the session desktop.

   ![](media/ba1.png)
   
1. In the Access local resource pop-up window, Click on **Allow**.

   ![](media/ba2.png)
   
1. In Enter your Credentials pop-up window, Provide the Username and Password of NMM User 01 and click on **Submit**.

   ![](media/ba7.png)
   
1. Once logged into the session host, Search for **Word** ***(1)*** application using the search bar. We will be able to find the **Word application** ***(2)*** as NMM User 02 is part of the AVD MS Office users group. This confirms the working of the App masking rule set.

1. Sign out from the session host by clicking on the **sign out** from the top-right corner.

## Exercise 2: Verifying the User profiles stored in the File Share

In this exercise, We'll be verifying the user profiles stored in a file share in the Azure portal.

1. From the Azure Portal, search for *storage accounts* in the search bar and click on **Storage Accounts** from the suggestions.

   ![ws name.](media/4s17.png)
   
1. Select the **fslogix<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** storage account which was created while creating the NMM account.

   ![ws name.](media/4s18.1.png)
   
1. Select **File shares** from the left side menu.

   ![ws name.](media/4s19.1.png)
   
1. Click on the **fsprofilestore** file share.

   ![ws name.](media/4s20.png)
   
1. Click on **browse (1)**, You will see the user **folder (2)** created in the file share, click on any one of the folders.

   ![ws name.](media/L8-EX2-S5.png)
   
7. Now you will be able to see the user profile data stored in the filesharers in a ***.vhd*** format.
